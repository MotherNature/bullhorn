## Authenticate

To authenticate, ready to call any endpoint, run `api/auth.php`. It will list out the files required to store credentials (ID, secret, etc).

## Endpoint

Once authenticated, simply run `api/endpoint.php` and pass in the arguments. The script will pass back the JSON response from the API.
